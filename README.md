# Omega - Agentic Software Migration System

An intelligent agentic system designed to aid in software migrations from monolithic to microservices architectures.

## Overview

Omega is a comprehensive project that demonstrates the various capabilities and workflows necessary to successfully decompose monolithic applications into microservices. By leveraging agentic systems and intelligent automation, this project provides practical tools and methodologies for one of the most challenging aspects of modern software architecture evolution.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of the Omega project are to:

- **Demonstrate Migration Workflows**: Showcase end-to-end processes for breaking down monolithic applications
- **Provide Intelligent Automation**: Utilize agentic systems to assist in complex migration decisions
- **Establish Best Practices**: Document proven methodologies for microservices decomposition
- **Enable Practical Implementation**: Offer tools and frameworks that can be applied to real-world migration projects

## Key Capabilities

### Automated Analysis
- Codebase dependency mapping
- Service boundary identification
- Data flow analysis
- API interface discovery

### Migration Planning
- Decomposition strategy generation
- Migration roadmap creation
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Resource estimation and timeline planning

### Implementation Support
- Code refactoring assistance
- API design and documentation
- Database schema migration
- Infrastructure provisioning guidance

### Validation & Testing
- Migration validation frameworks
- Performance comparison tools
- Integration testing automation
- Rollback strategy implementation

## Architecture

The system is built using modern development practices and containerized environments:

- **Development Environment**: Docker-based dev containers for consistent development experience
- **Version Control**: Git with comprehensive documentation and workflow guides
- **Documentation**: Structured documentation for all processes and procedures
- **Extensibility**: Modular design allowing for custom migration scenarios

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git with SSH access to GitHub
- VS Code with Dev Container extension (recommended)

### Quick Start
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:ea-datascience/omega.git
   cd omega
   ```

2. Open in VS Code and reopen in container when prompted
   
3. The development environment will automatically set up with Python 3.12 and all necessary dependencies

### Documentation
Comprehensive guides are available in the `/docs` directory:
- [Git Setup](./docs/git/README.md) - SSH configuration and repository management
- Additional documentation sections will be added as the project evolves

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions from developers interested in microservices migration, agentic systems, and software architecture evolution. Please refer to the documentation for setup instructions and development guidelines.
