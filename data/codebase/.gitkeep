# .gitkeep

This file ensures that the `data/codebase` directory is tracked by Git.

This directory is intended for:
- Reference codebases for migration analysis and pattern learning
- Spring Modulith reference implementation (excluded from Git via .gitignore)
- Other well-architected monolithic applications for study
- Codebase samples for testing migration tools and algorithms

The Spring Modulith codebase is excluded from version control but should be present
for development and testing. Use the clone script to populate:
- `/tools/src/clone-spring-modulith.sh`

Other reference codebases can be added here as needed for comprehensive
migration pattern analysis and validation.
