# SDLC Migration Processes and Tools

This directory contains draft documentation for the software development life cycle processes, diagrams, and tools necessary for enterprise-grade monolith-to-microservices migration using the Omega Agentic Migration System.

## Directory Structure

### `/diagrams/`
Visual representations of migration processes, workflows, and system architectures:
- Process flow diagrams
- System architecture diagrams  
- Agent interaction diagrams
- Data flow visualizations
- Decision tree diagrams

### `/processes/`
Detailed process documentation for migration workflows:
- Migration lifecycle processes
- Human approval workflows
- Quality assurance processes
- Risk assessment procedures
- Validation and testing processes

### `/tools/`
Tool specifications and integration documentation:
- Required toolchain documentation
- Integration specifications
- Configuration templates
- Automation scripts and workflows
- Monitoring and observability setup

## Purpose

This documentation supports the development of:

1. **Standardized Migration Processes**: Repeatable, enterprise-grade workflows for monolith decomposition
2. **Tool Integration Strategy**: Comprehensive toolchain for automated analysis, code generation, and validation
3. **Quality Assurance Framework**: Testing, validation, and approval processes for migration safety
4. **Operational Procedures**: Monitoring, rollback, and maintenance processes for production migrations

## Integration with PRD

These processes and tools directly support the business requirements defined in `/workspace/prds/001-omega-migration-system.md`, specifically:

- **R1: Legacy System Analysis & Assessment** - Analysis tools and processes
- **R2: AI-Powered Service Boundary Identification** - Decision workflows and validation processes  
- **R3: Migration Planning & Risk Assessment** - Planning processes and risk management tools
- **R4: Automated Code Generation & Refactoring** - Code generation tools and quality processes
- **R5: Human-in-the-Loop Oversight** - Approval workflows and governance processes
- **R6: Migration Validation & Quality Assurance** - Testing frameworks and validation tools

## Development Status

**Status**: Draft - Initial structure created  
**Next Steps**: 
1. Define core migration lifecycle processes
2. Create process flow diagrams
3. Specify required toolchain and integrations
4. Develop quality assurance frameworks
